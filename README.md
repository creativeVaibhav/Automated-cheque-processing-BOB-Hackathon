BOB-Hackathon

Bank handles large volumes of cheques in the clearing process. The process involves many technical verifications including signature verification. Some of these steps are manual and require human intervention to complete the process. The current process requires the high human capital deployment and longer processing time.

This model is mainly prepared for banks, people, government. Manual check processing is very complex, time consuming and having chances of bouncing the cheques. Generally in manual checking there are a chances of hacking the account and in withdrawal of cash by doing handwritten signature. Through this product, we can reduce this above mentioned problem and it measures the data very accurately and extract the feature very accurately as well. Automated cheque processing is doing by Optical Character Recognition (OCR), image acquisition, Magnetic ink character recognition (MICR). This model also reduced white spaces and does not compromised with quality.

It is an under construction project.
